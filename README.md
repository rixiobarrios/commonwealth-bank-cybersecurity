## Create a Website

Build a local website with HTML/CSS

Here is your task
To complete the Task, follow the steps below:

### Project Setup

1. Before you begin, review the links in the Additional Resources section below. One of the links provides extra information on getting started with Visual Studio Code if you do not already have a text editor. The other links provide instructions on how to get started creating your first local HTML/CSS project. 

2. Install a text editor if you do not already have one. We suggest Visual Code Studio.

3. Using your file manager, create a folder in the directory of your choice. This folder is where you’ll be storing your HTML and CSS files.

4. In your text editor, create a new file called ‘index.html.’ This will be your primary website file.

5. Create another file called ‘index.css.’ This is the file that will contain stylization information for customising your web page.

Create your Web Page

1. Start by inserting the following boiler-plate code into your index.html file:
```
<html>

  <head>

<title>Title Text</title>

  </head>

  <body>

<h1>Title Text</h1>

<p>Body Text</p>

  </body>

</html>
```
2. Next, you need to link your index.css file to your index.html file. This is necessary so that the styles you add in the index.css file are applied to your index.html file. To link these files, add the following code between the <head> tags in your index.html file:
```
<link href="index.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
```
3. Next, insert the following boiler-plate code into your index.css file. Feel free to customise this as you would like:
```
* {

font-family: Arial;

}

h1 {

color: Blue;

font-size: 36px;

}

p {

font-size: 18px;

color: Gray;

}
```
4. In your index.html file, update the title text of your website to read ‘Tips for Financial Cybersecurity,’ and update the body text with placeholder values of your choice.

View your Web Page

1. Navigate to the index.html file in your file manager.

2. Click on the file to open it. By default, the page will be launched in your web browser.

3. Experiment with changing or adding new values to the index.css file. These changes will only be reflected when you reopen your index.html file.# commonwealth-bank-cybersecurity-website

### Add Content

1. Review the Additional Resources section below to learn about securing financial accounts and financial cybersecurity. 
 
2. After reviewing the resources, write a list of tips and tricks to help bank clients improve their financial cybersecurity. You may want to break your list up into subheadings that list the tip and include a paragraph that briefly explains it. Aim for your write-up to contain about 300-400 words total.
 
3. Open your index.html file from Task 1 in your code editor. Replace the body text placeholder values with your list of tips for improving financial cybersecurity. Enclose any subheadings in
``` 
<h2> tags and any paragraph text in <p> tags.
```
4. As in Task 1, navigate to the index.html file in your file manager.
 
5. Click on the index.html file to open it. By default, the page will be launched in your web browser. Review your website to ensure it looks as expected.
 
6. Once you’ve ensured your web page looks right, zip your HTML and CSS files into a single folder, and then submit the zipped file as your deliverable for this Task.

### Add Styles

1. If needed, review the Additional Resources below to review the basics of CSS.

2. Open your index.css and index.html files in your code editor. The index.css file is where you’ll be making the majority of your changes for this Task. However, you may want to add additional tags to your index.html files to explore additional customisation options.

3. Open the index.html file in your browser. As you make style changes in the index.css file, you’ll need to refresh your browser page to see the new changes.

4. Start by customising the background colours on your page. Ensure you use at least one primary colour and at least one secondary colour, as defined in the background section. You can define these colours using their HEX code in the index.css file.

5. Customise your fonts. Ensure that all your font colors and text sizes are correct based on the guidelines above.

6. Continue to experiment with the above customisation options until you’re happy with the appearance of your page.

7. When you’ve met all the requirements in the guidelines above, zip your HTML and CSS files into a single folder. Then, submit the zipped file as your deliverable for this Task.

### Write a Web Hosting Proposal

1. Review the Additional Resources below to learn how to securely host a website. Be sure to take notes on information that will be relevant for your proposal!
 
2. After reviewing the resources, write up a proposal for how you should go about securely hosting your website. Be sure to communicate any information that will be important to consider when initially setting up your website. Your proposal should also address any potential challenges with securely hosting your website.
 
3. Once you’ve written your proposal, review it for clarity. Is there any more information that you should communicate with your manager?
 
4. Your proposal should be about 300-400 words.
