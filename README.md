Task 1
## Create a Website

Build a local website with HTML/CSS

Here is your task
To complete the Task, follow the steps below:

### Project Setup

1. Before you begin, review the links in the Additional Resources section below. One of the links provides extra information on getting started with Visual Studio Code if you do not already have a text editor. The other links provide instructions on how to get started creating your first local HTML/CSS project. 

2. Install a text editor if you do not already have one. We suggest Visual Code Studio.

3. Using your file manager, create a folder in the directory of your choice. This folder is where you’ll be storing your HTML and CSS files.

4. In your text editor, create a new file called ‘index.html.’ This will be your primary website file.

5. Create another file called ‘index.css.’ This is the file that will contain stylization information for customising your web page.

Create your Web Page

1. Start by inserting the following boiler-plate code into your index.html file:
```
<html>

  <head>

<title>Title Text</title>

  </head>

  <body>

<h1>Title Text</h1>

<p>Body Text</p>

  </body>

</html>
```
2. Next, you need to link your index.css file to your index.html file. This is necessary so that the styles you add in the index.css file are applied to your index.html file. To link these files, add the following code between the <head> tags in your index.html file:
```
<link href="index.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
```
3. Next, insert the following boiler-plate code into your index.css file. Feel free to customise this as you would like:
```
* {

font-family: Arial;

}

h1 {

color: Blue;

font-size: 36px;

}

p {

font-size: 18px;

color: Gray;

}
```
4. In your index.html file, update the title text of your website to read ‘Tips for Financial Cybersecurity,’ and update the body text with placeholder values of your choice.

View your Web Page

1. Navigate to the index.html file in your file manager.

2. Click on the file to open it. By default, the page will be launched in your web browser.

3. Experiment with changing or adding new values to the index.css file. These changes will only be reflected when you reopen your index.html file.# commonwealth-bank-cybersecurity-website
